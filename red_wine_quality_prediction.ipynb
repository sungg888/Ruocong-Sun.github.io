    "In this project our group seeks to use machine learning algorithms to predict wine quality (scale of 0 to 10) using physiochemical properties of the liquid. We use a train-test split and cross-validation to simulate the model encountering unseen data. We use and tune the parameters of several classification models: logistic regression, decision tree, kNN, and SVM RBF to see which one has the highest accuracy, and then deploy the winner onto the test set. The final test set accuracy is around {glue:text}`test_set_score` percent. Depending on the standard, this can be decent or poor. However, a more important note is that for the really extreme quality ones (below 5 or above 6), the model was unable to identify quite a few of them correctly, suggesting that it is not very robust to outliers. We include a final discussion section on some of the potential causes for this performance as well as proposed solutions for any future analysis."

    "Red wines have a long history that can be traced all the way back to the ancient Greeks. Today, they are more accessible to an average person than ever and the entire industry is estimated to be worth around 109.5 billion USD (The Business Research Company). Despite its ubiquity, most people can barely tell the difference between a good and a bad wine, to the point where we need trained professionals (sommeliers) to understand the difference. In this project, we seek to use machine learning algorithms to predict the quality of the wine based on the physiochemical properties of the liquid.  This model, if effective, could allow manufactures and suppliers to have a more robust understanding of the wine quality based on measurable properties."

    "In this project, we built several machine learning classification models seeking to predict the wine quality based on the physiochemical properties of the liquid. By trying out different models with different hyperparameters, we have found that for our data set, the best performing model is RBF SVM. However, despite being the best, the accuracy is only around {glue:text}`test_set_score` percent. Depending on the situation this can be poor or decent. More importantly, the algorithm seems to not be able to identify the outliers precisely, and in the case where people want to be able to find really good or bad wines, this model's performance would not be able to meet people's expectations. Our group's discussion has concluded that there might be several factors leading to this phenomenon:\n",

Additionally, due to the limited scope of our data set (no observation below {glue:text}`min_wine_quality` or above {glue:text}`max_wine_quality`), a classification model trained on this data set would not be able to identify any observation outside of the scope correctly. A regression algorithm is more immune to this kind of problem. \n",

    "Despite the potential improvements we have identified (or not) for our project, there still exists a possibility that even with all these improvements, the accuracy would not improve that much. And that is not due to the incorrect setup for the analyses, but rather the fact that some of the underlying uncontrollable factors in the process of wine making simply makes it impossible to detect patterns for really good or bad wines, and their qualities can only determined by actually tasting rather than prediction using numerical representations of some of its properties. However, among all the possible problems we have identified, this is the only one where we have zero proposed solutions for."
