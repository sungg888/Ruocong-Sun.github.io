#### [Github Repository](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction) 
#### - This project is based on a real-world data set and designed and implemented in Python. 
#### - This project is reproducible by using a virtual environment or docker container(provided in GitHub repository)  
#### - By using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree model, KNN, and SVM to predict wine quality.
#### - Optimize hyperparameters for algorithm models.
