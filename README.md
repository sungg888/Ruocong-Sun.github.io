## Red Wine Quality Prediction
#### [Github Repository](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction)
#### [Report](https://ubc-mds.github.io/Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction/red_wine_quality_prediction.html)
#### - This project involves using machine learning to predict wine quality on a scale from 0 to 10, based on its physiochemical properties. The best model(SVM RBF) achieved a final test set accuracy of approximately 62.3%. 
#### - By employing a train-test split and cross-validation to ensure the model can handle unseen data. Various classification models were tested, including logistic regression, decision tree, kNN, and SVM RBF, to determine which offers the highest accuracy. This performance could be considered either modest or suboptimal depending on the expectations. A key observation is the model's difficulty in accurately predicting wines of extreme quality (either below 5 or above 6), indicating a lack of robustness to outliers.
#### - This project is reproducible by using a virtual environment or docker container(provided in GitHub repository)  
#### - Optimized hyperparameters for algorithm models.
